## Description
Bayesian probability and statistical distributions analysis.

## Main Features
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Medical diagnostic test probability calculation
- **Disease Testing**: Analyzes probability of disease given positive test result
- **Statistical Distributions**: Visualization of normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions
- **Real-world Application**: Medical test accuracy scenario (1% disease prevalence)

## Key Components
- `bayes_theorem()`: Calculates posterior probability using sensitivity/specificity
- Prior probability: 1% disease prevalence
- Test accuracy: 95% sensitivity, 90% specificity
- Distribution plotting with matplotlib and scipy.stats

## Use Case
Demonstrates how test accuracy affects diagnostic confidence in medical scenarios.
